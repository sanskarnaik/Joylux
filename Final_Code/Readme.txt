1.)Final_code folder contains Final_Code.ino which is a arduino code 
for the arduino Nano board that we used in our Capstone Project.

2.)It also contains the Button Library that I have used in my arduino code.(Convert this into a zip folder, before
adding to the Arduino IDE).

3.)To run this code, you need to open the Final_code.ino using Arduino IDE software
Select the Arduino Nano board from Boards Manager. In Sketch tab, goto include library options
and select add libray .zip.
From here you can select the Button.zip folder.
Now you are good to run the code.
